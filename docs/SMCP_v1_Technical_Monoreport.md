## Abstract

The Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP) v1 represents a comprehensive security framework designed to address critical vulnerabilities in AI agent interactions through the Model Context Protocol. This technical monoreport provides an exhaustive analysis of the framework's architecture, implementation, security properties, and operational characteristics.

The framework implements six integrated security layers: input validation with context-aware sanitization, multi-factor authentication with JWT-based session management, fine-grained role-based access control, adaptive rate limiting with DoS protection, cryptographic security using ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD, and an AI-based immune system for anomaly detection. Each layer is designed to operate independently while contributing to defense-in-depth.

This document serves as the definitive technical reference for security researchers, system architects, and implementation engineers working with SMCP v1.

# Part I: Foundations

# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

The proliferation of artificial intelligence agents in enterprise and consumer applications has introduced novel security challenges that traditional security frameworks fail to adequately address. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, provides a standardized interface for AI agents to interact with external tools, data sources, and services. However, the original MCP specification lacks comprehensive security mechanisms, leaving implementations vulnerable to a wide range of attacks.

The Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP) v1 was developed to address these security gaps through a defense-in-depth approach that combines multiple independent security layers. Each layer addresses specific threat categories while contributing to overall system security.

### Security Challenges in AI Agent Interactions

AI agents operating through the MCP face unique security challenges:

1. Dynamic Input Processing: AI-generated inputs may contain malicious patterns that traditional input validation fails to detect.

2. Privilege Amplification: Agents often require elevated privileges to perform their tasks, creating opportunities for privilege escalation.

3. Context Manipulation: Adversaries can manipulate the context provided to AI agents to influence their behavior.

4. Resource Exhaustion: Unbounded agent operations can lead to denial of service.

5. Data Exfiltration: Agents with access to sensitive data require strong confidentiality guarantees.

6. Supply Chain Attacks: MCP tools and resources may be compromised at their source.

### Design Philosophy

SMCP v1 is designed around several core principles:

Defense in Depth: Multiple independent security layers provide redundant protection. A failure in one layer does not compromise overall security.

Fail Secure: Security failures result in denial of access rather than unauthorized access. The system defaults to secure states.

Least Privilege: Entities are granted only the minimum permissions necessary for their function.

Complete Mediation: Every access to protected resources is checked for authorization.

Open Design: Security does not depend on secrecy of implementation. The framework is open source and subject to public scrutiny.

Psychological Acceptability: Security mechanisms impose minimal burden on legitimate users while effectively blocking adversaries.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by SMCP v1 can be formally stated as follows:

Given:
- A set of AI agents A = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ} interacting through MCP
- A set of protected resources R = {r₁, r₂, ..., rₘ}
- A set of potential attacks T = {t₁, t₂, ..., tₖ}
- Performance constraints P defining acceptable overhead

Find:
A security framework F such that:
1. For all attacks t ∈ T, the probability of successful attack P(success|t) < ε for some small ε
2. For all legitimate operations o ∈ O, the probability of false rejection P(reject|o) < δ for some small δ
3. The performance overhead OH < P
4. The framework satisfies standard security properties: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, and availability

### Threat Model

SMCP v1 operates under the following threat model:

Adversary Capabilities:
- Network access: Adversary can intercept, modify, and inject network traffic
- Client compromise: Adversary may control malicious or compromised clients
- Insider threats: Adversary may have legitimate but limited access
- Side channels: Adversary can observe timing and resource consumption

Protected Assets:
- Server resources and computational capacity
- Data confidentiality and integrity
- User credentials and session tokens
- System availability and reliability

Out of Scope:
- Physical attacks on server hardware
- Compromise of underlying operating system or container runtime
- Attacks on AI models themselves (model extraction, poisoning)
- Social engineering of legitimate users

## 1.3 Scope and Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. Comprehensive Security: Provide protection against all common attack vectors targeting MCP implementations.

2. Layered Defense: Implement independent security layers that collectively provide defense-in-depth.

3. Performance: Maintain security overhead below 5% for typical workloads.

4. Usability: Provide clear APIs and configuration options that make secure implementation straightforward.

5. Auditability: Generate comprehensive audit logs suitable for compliance and forensic analysis.

6. Extensibility: Allow customization and extension without compromising core security properties.

### Scope Boundaries

In Scope:
- Security of MCP server implementations
- Authentication and authorization of MCP clients
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DoS protection
- Cryptographic protection of sensitive data
- Anomaly detection and threat classification
- Audit logging and compliance

Out of Scope:
- Security of AI models themselves

---

# Chapter 2: Model Context Protocol Overview

## 2.1 MCP Architecture

The Model Context Protocol defines a standard architecture for AI agents to interact with external capabilities. Understanding the base MCP architecture is essential for comprehending SMCP's security enhancements.

### Core Components

MCP consists of four primary components:

1. MCP Server: Exposes tools, resources, and prompts to clients
2. MCP Client: Consumes MCP services (typically an AI agent)
3. Transport Layer: Handles message exchange (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket)
4. Protocol Layer: Defines message formats and semantics

### Communication Model

MCP uses a bidirectional request-response communication model:

```
Client                    Server
  |                         |
  |---- Initialize -------->|
  |<--- Initialized --------|
  |                         |
  |---- tools/list -------->|
  |<--- Tool List ----------|
  |                         |
  |---- tools/call -------->|
  |<--- Result -------------|
```

### Message Types

MCP defines several message categories:

1. Initialization: Protocol version negotiation and capability exchange
2. Tool Operations: List available tools, invoke tools with parameters
3. Resource Operations: List resources, read resource contents
4. Prompt Operations: List prompt templates, retrieve prompts
5. Notification: Server-initiated messages to clients

## 2.2 Communication Patterns

### Request-Response Pattern

Most MCP interactions follow a request-response pattern:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_database",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "SELECT * FROM users"
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Found 100 users"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Notification Pattern

Servers can send asynchronous notifications:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/resources/updated",
  "params": {
    "uri": "file:///data/users.db"
  }
}
```

### Streaming Pattern

For long-running operations, MCP supports streaming responses through transport-specific mechanisms (e.g., Server-Sent Events over HTTP).

## 2.3 Message Formats

### JSON-RPC 2.0 Base

MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 as its base message format. All messages must be valid JSON and conform to JSON-RPC structure.

### Tool Call Message

Structure for invoking tools:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": <number|string>,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": <tool_name>,
    "arguments": <tool_arguments>
  }
}
```

### Resource Read Message

Structure for reading resources:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": <number|string>,
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": {
    "uri": <resource_uri>
  }
}
```

### Error Message

Standard error format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": <number|string>,
  "error": {
    "code": <error_code>,
    "message": <error_message>,
    "data": <additional_data>
  }
}
```

## 2.4 Transport Mechanisms

### Standard I/O Transport

The simplest transport uses stdin/stdout for local communication:

```
Client Process          Server Process
  stdout ----------------> stdin
  stdin  <---------------- stdout
```

Messages are newline-delimited JSON.

### HTTP Transport

HTTP transport uses POST requests to a single endpoint:

```
POST /mcp HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "id": 1}
```

### WebSocket Transport

WebSocket provides bidirectional communication over a single connection:

```
wss://server.example.com/mcp

Client -> Server: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/call", ...}
Server -> Client: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {...}}
```

## 2.5 Standard Operations

### Initialization

Clients must initialize the connection before other operations:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {"listChanged": true},
      "sampling": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Listing

Clients discover available tools:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/list"
}
```

Server response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "search_database",
        "description": "Search user database",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "query": {"type": "string"}
          },
          "required": ["query"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Tool Invocation

Clients invoke tools with parameters:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_database",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "admin users"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2.6 Security Challenges

The base MCP specification provides minimal security guidance, leading to several challenges:

### Challenge 1: Input Validation

MCP does not specify how servers should validate tool arguments or resource URIs. This leaves implementations vulnerable to injection attacks:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "execute_command",
    "arguments": {
      "command": "ls; rm -rf /"
    }
  }
}
```

### Challenge 2: Authentication

MCP does not define authentication mechanisms. Clients could be:
- Anonymous users
- Authenticated users with varying privilege levels
- Compromised agents with stolen credentials

Without authentication, servers cannot enforce access control.

### Challenge 3: Authorization

Even with authentication, MCP lacks authorization primitives. All authenticated clients have access to all tools and resources.

### Challenge 4: Rate Limiting

MCP provides no guidance on rate limiting. Malicious or malfunctioning clients can exhaust server resources:

```
Client sends 10,000 tool calls per second
→ Server resources exhausted
→ Denial of service
```

### Challenge 5: Data Protection

MCP does not specify encryption or data protection mechanisms. Sensitive data transmitted through MCP may be:
- Intercepted by network adversaries
- Logged insecurely
- Stored without encryption

### Challenge 6: Anomaly Detection

MCP lacks mechanisms to detect abnormal behavior:
- Unusual access patterns
- Potential data exfiltration
- Compromised agent behavior

### Security Requirements Derived

These challenges lead to the following security requirements that SMCP addresses:

R1: Input Validation - All inputs must be validated and sanitized before processing

R2: Authentication - All clients must be authenticated before access is granted

R3: Authorization - Access to tools and resources must be controlled based on client identity and privileges

R4: Rate Limiting - Request rates must be limited to prevent resource exhaustion

R5: Data Protection - Sensitive data must be protected through cryptographic means

R6: Anomaly Detection - Unusual patterns must be detected and responded to

R7: Audit Logging - All security-relevant events must be logged for forensic analysis

R8: Fail Secure - Security failures must result in denial of access, not unauthorized access

# Chapter 3: Threat Model

## 3.1 Adversary Capabilities

SMCP's threat model defines the capabilities we assume adversaries possess. This informs our security design and helps evaluate whether the framework provides adequate protection.

### Network Adversary (Dolev-Yao Model)

We assume a network adversary with the following capabilities:

1. Message Interception: Adversary can read all network traffic
2. Message Modification: Adversary can modify messages in transit
3. Message Injection: Adversary can inject arbitrary messages
4. Replay: Adversary can replay previously observed messages
5. Delay: Adversary can delay message delivery

Formally, the adversary controls the network function N:

```
N: Messages × Time → Messages × Time
```

The adversary cannot:
- Break cryptographic primitives (under standard assumptions)
- Compromise the server's private keys or secure storage
- Physically access server hardware

### Malicious Client

We assume adversaries can create or compromise MCP clients with capabilities:

1. Protocol Conformance: Can send well-formed or malformed MCP messages
2. High Volume: Can generate requests at arbitrary rates
3. Intelligent Attacks: Can adapt behavior based on server responses
4. Coordination: Multiple compromised clients can coordinate

Malicious clients cannot:
- Exceed their authenticated privilege level (assuming authentication works)
- Access server memory or file system directly
- Compromise other clients

### Insider Threat

We consider insiders with legitimate but limited access:

1. Authenticated Access: Has valid credentials for limited privileges
2. Knowledge: Understands system architecture and normal behavior
3. Goal: Attempts to exceed authorized privileges or access

Insiders cannot:
- Access resources outside their authorization
- Compromise the authorization mechanism itself
- Gain administrative privileges through the MCP interface

### Side-Channel Observer

We assume adversaries who can observe side channels:

1. Timing: Can measure response times
2. Resource Usage: Can observe CPU, memory, network utilization
3. Error Patterns: Can observe error messages and types

Side-channel adversaries cannot:
- Recover cryptographic keys from timing alone (we use constant-time implementations where critical)
- Infer sensitive data from resource usage patterns

## 3.2 Attack Surface Analysis

1. HTTP/WebSocket Endpoints
   - Risk: Direct network access for remote adversaries
   - Attack Vectors: Protocol vulnerabilities, DoS, injection

   - Attack Vectors: Template injection, context manipulation

### Administrative Attack Surface

Components requiring elevated privileges:

1. Configuration Interface
   - Risk: Security policy modification
   - Attack Vectors: Configuration injection, insecure defaults

2. Key Management
   - Risk: Key compromise
   - Attack Vectors: Insecure storage, insufficient rotation

3. Audit Log Access
   - Risk: Evidence tampering
   - Attack Vectors: Log injection, log deletion

## 3.3 Threat Categories

We categorize threats using the STRIDE model:

### Spoofing (Identity)

### Elevation of Privilege (Authorization)

Threats where adversaries gain unauthorized privileges:

T15: Authorization Bypass - Adversary circumvents access control

- Likelihood: Low with proper RBAC
- Mitigation: Least privilege principle, role hierarchy validation

T17: Context Confusion - Adversary manipulates authorization context
- Impact: Wrong authorization decision
- Likelihood: Low
- Mitigation: Context binding, secure context propagation

## 3.4 Risk Assessment Methodology

We assess risk using:

```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

### Likelihood Scale

- Low (1): Requires significant resources or multiple preconditions
- Medium (2): Feasible for determined adversary
- High (3): Easy to exploit with common tools

### Impact Scale

- Low (1): Minor inconvenience, no security impact
- Medium (2): Limited security impact, affects individual users
- High (3): Severe security impact, affects system or multiple users

### Risk Matrix

```
Impact    │ Low (1) │ Medium (2) │ High (3)
──────────┼─────────┼────────────┼─────────
High (3)  │    3    │     6      │    9
Medium (2)│    2    │     4      │    6
Low (1)   │    1    │     2      │    3
```

Priority Mapping:
- Risk 7-9: Critical (must address before deployment)
- Risk 4-6: High (address in initial release)
- Risk 1-3: Medium (address in updates)

### Threat Risk Assessment

| Threat ID | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Risk | Priority |

| T15 | Elevation | 2 | 3 | 6 | High |
| T16 | Elevation | 1 | 3 | 3 | Medium |
| T17 | Elevation | 1 | 2 | 2 | Medium |

### Critical Threats

Four critical threats require immediate mitigation:

1. T1 (Client Impersonation): Addressed by Authentication Layer
2. T4 (Message Tampering): Addressed by Cryptography Layer  
3. T5 (Input Injection): Addressed by Input Validation Layer
4. T12 (Resource Exhaustion): Addressed by Rate Limiting Layer

## 3.5 Security Requirements Derivation

From our threat analysis, we derive formal security requirements:

### Requirement R1: Input Validation

For all inputs i ∈ I received from clients:
```
validate(i) = true ∨ reject(i)
```

Where validate(i) checks:
- Schema conformance
- Type correctness
- Range bounds
- Pattern matching (no injection patterns)
- Context appropriateness

Mitigates: T5 (Input Injection), T13 (Algorithmic Complexity)

### Requirement R2: Authentication

For all requests r from client c:
```
process(r) → authenticated(c) = true
```

Where authenticated(c) requires:
- Valid credentials presented
- Credentials verified against credential store
- Optional: Multi-factor verification
- Session token generated and bound to c

Mitigates: T1 (Client Impersonation), T2 (Session Hijacking)

### Requirement R3: Authorization

For all operations o on resource res by client c:
```
allow(c, o, res) → authorized(c, o, res) = true
```

Where authorized checks:
- Client c has role r
- Role r has permission p
- Permission p allows operation o on resource res
- Context constraints satisfied

Mitigates: T15 (Authorization Bypass), T16 (Privilege Escalation)

### Requirement R4: Rate Limiting

For all clients c and time windows w:
```
requests(c, w) ≤ limit(c, w)
```

Where limit(c, w) is determined by:
- Client privilege level
- Resource type
- Historical behavior
- Current system load

Mitigates: T12 (Resource Exhaustion), T14 (Distributed DoS)

### Requirement R5: Data Protection

For all sensitive data d:
```
transmit(d) → encrypted(d) = true
store(d) → encrypted(d) = true
```

Where encryption uses:
- Authenticated encryption (AEAD)
- Strong key derivation
- Secure key storage
- Regular key rotation

Mitigates: T4 (Message Tampering), T9 (Data Exfiltration), T10 (Credential Disclosure)

### Requirement R6: Anomaly Detection

For all request sequences S from client c:
```
anomaly_score(S) > threshold → flag(c, S)
```

Where anomaly detection considers:
- Request patterns
- Resource access patterns
- Timing characteristics
- Parameter distributions

Mitigates: T9 (Data Exfiltration), T15 (Authorization Bypass)

### Requirement R7: Audit Logging

For all security-relevant events e:
```
occurs(e) → logged(e) = true ∧ tamper_resistant(log)
```

Where logs capture:
- Event type and timestamp
- Principal (who)
- Operation (what)
- Resource (on what)
- Outcome (success/failure)
- Context (why)

Mitigates: T7 (Action Denial), T8 (Log Tampering)

### Requirement R8: Fail Secure

For all security checks c:
```
failure(c) → deny_access
```

The system must:
- Default to secure state on error
- Never fail open
- Provide clear error messages without information disclosure
- Log all security failures

Mitigates: All threats by preventing bypass through error conditions

## 3.6 Compliance Considerations

SMCP design considers compliance with major regulatory frameworks:

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

- Article 32 (Security): Encryption, access control, audit logging
- Article 25 (Privacy by Design): Default deny, minimal data collection
- Article 33 (Breach Notification): Audit logs enable breach detection

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

- Technical Safeguards: Access control, audit controls, transmission security
- Administrative Safeguards: Security management process
- Physical Safeguards: Not addressed (out of scope)

### SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)

- Security: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- Availability: Rate limiting, DoS protection
- Confidentiality: Data encryption, access control
- Processing Integrity: Input validation, integrity checks

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

- Requirement 2: Strong authentication
- Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission
- Requirement 6: Secure code (input validation)
- Requirement 10: Track and monitor access

SMCP provides technical controls that support compliance but does not guarantee compliance alone. Organizations must implement additional administrative and physical controls.

# Part II: Architecture

# Chapter 4: Security Architecture Overview

## 4.1 Design Principles

SMCP's architecture is guided by foundational security principles established in academic literature and industry best practices.

### Defense in Depth

Multiple independent security layers provide redundant protection. If one layer fails or is bypassed, others continue to provide security.

Formally, if L₁, L₂, ..., Lₙ are security layers:
```
P(breach) = P(bypass L₁) × P(bypass L₂) × ... × P(bypass Lₙ)
```

Assuming independence, each layer multiplicatively reduces breach probability.

### Complete Mediation

Every access to every resource is checked for authorization. No caching of authorization decisions that could become stale.

For all operations o on resource r:
```
∀o, r: access(o, r) → check_authorization(current_context, o, r)
```

### Fail Secure

When errors occur, the system defaults to the secure state (deny access) rather than the insecure state (allow access).

```python
try:
    if not authorize(user, resource):
        return DENY
    return process_request()
except Exception:
    return DENY  # Fail secure
```

### Least Privilege

Entities are granted only the minimum privileges necessary for their function. This limits damage from compromise.

### Economy of Mechanism

Security mechanisms are kept as simple as possible. Complexity is the enemy of security. Simple mechanisms are easier to verify, audit, and implement correctly.

### Separation of Privilege

Critical operations require multiple independent privileges. No single privilege grants complete access.

For example, accessing encrypted data requires:
1. Authorization to access the resource
2. Possession of decryption key
3. Valid authentication token

### Psychological Acceptability

Security mechanisms should be easy to use correctly. If security is too burdensome, users will work around it.

SMCP achieves this through:
- Sensible defaults (secure by default)
- Clear error messages
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy configuration

## 4.2 Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture

SMCP uses a layered architecture where each layer provides specific security functions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Application Layer            │
│    (MCP Server Implementation)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↕
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     SMCP Security Framework          │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Layer 6: AI Immune System      │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Layer 5: Cryptography          │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Layer 4: Rate Limiting         │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Layer 3: Authorization         │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Layer 2: Authentication        │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Layer 1: Input Validation      │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↕
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Transport Layer                │
│   (HTTP/WebSocket/stdio)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Request Processing Pipeline

Requests flow through layers sequentially:

```
Incoming Request
     ↓
[Layer 1] Input Validation
     ↓ (validated)
[Layer 2] Authentication
     ↓ (authenticated)
[Layer 3] Authorization
     ↓ (authorized)
[Layer 4] Rate Limiting
     ↓ (rate checked)
[Layer 5] Cryptographic Processing
     ↓ (decrypted if needed)
[Layer 6] AI Immune System
     ↓ (anomaly checked)
[Application] Business Logic
     ↓
[Layer 5] Cryptographic Processing
     ↓ (encrypted if needed)
[Layer 6] Audit Logging
     ↓
Outgoing Response
```

Each layer can:
1. Pass request to next layer
2. Reject request (fail secure)
3. Modify request (e.g., sanitize inputs)
4. Add context (e.g., authentication info)

### Audit Logging Pattern

All layers generate security events that flow to the audit system:

```
Layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
     ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓
    Security Events
          ↓
   [Audit Logger]
          ↓
  ┌──────┴──────┐
  ↓             ↓
Log File    SIEM System
```

## 4.3 Layer Interaction Model

Layers interact through well-defined interfaces:

### Context Propagation

Context flows forward through layers:

```python
class SecurityContext:
    validated_request: Dict[str, Any]  # From Layer 1
    auth_info: AuthInfo                # From Layer 2
    permissions: Set[Permission]       # From Layer 3
    rate_limit_status: RateLimitInfo  # From Layer 4
    crypto_metadata: CryptoMetadata    # From Layer 5
    anomaly_score: float               # From Layer 6
```

Each layer adds information that subsequent layers can use.

### Event Propagation

Security events propagate to audit system:

```python
class SecurityEvent:
    timestamp: datetime
    layer: int  # Which layer generated event
    severity: EventSeverity
    category: EventCategory
    principal: str  # Who (user, client)
    action: str     # What happened
    resource: str   # On what resource
    outcome: str    # Success/failure
    details: Dict   # Additional info
```

### Failure Propagation

Failures propagate backward as exceptions:

```python
class SecurityError(Exception):
    layer: int
    reason: str
    should_log: bool = True
    should_alert: bool = False
```

When a layer detects a security violation:
1. Create SecurityEvent for audit log
2. Raise SecurityError
3. Framework catches exception
4. Returns appropriate error to client
5. Logs security event

## 4.4 Trust Boundaries

SMCP defines clear trust boundaries:

### External Boundary

Separates untrusted network from SMCP framework:

```
Untrusted Network
─────────────────── Trust Boundary 1
Transport Layer (HTTP/WebSocket)
─────────────────── Trust Boundary 2
SMCP Framework
```

All data crossing Boundary 1 is untrusted and must be validated.

### Authentication Boundary

Separates unauthenticated requests from authenticated requests:

```
Unauthenticated Request
─────────────────── Trust Boundary 3
Layer 2: Authentication
─────────────────── Trust Boundary 4
Authenticated Context
```

Only authenticated requests proceed past Layer 2.

### Authorization Boundary

Separates authorized operations from unauthorized:

```
Authenticated Request
─────────────────── Trust Boundary 5
Layer 3: Authorization
─────────────────── Trust Boundary 6
Authorized Operation
```

### Application Boundary

Separates SMCP framework from application logic:

```
SMCP Framework
─────────────────── Trust Boundary 7
Application Logic
```

Application receives validated, authenticated, and authorized requests.

## 4.5 Security Properties

SMCP provides formal security properties:

### Property 1: Authentication

For all requests r processed by the framework:
```
processed(r) → authenticated(source(r))
```

No unauthenticated request reaches application logic.

### Property 2: Authorization

For all operations o on resource res:
```
executed(o, res) → authorized(principal, o, res)
```

No unauthorized operation is executed.

### Property 3: Validation

For all inputs i from clients:
```
processed(i) → validated(i)
```

No invalid input reaches application logic.

### Property 4: Confidentiality

For all sensitive data d:
```
transmitted(d) → encrypted(d) ∨ local_only(d)
```

Sensitive data is encrypted in transit.

### Property 5: Integrity

For all messages m:
```
accepted(m) → integrity_verified(m)
```

Messages are verified for integrity before acceptance.

### Property 6: Availability

For all clients c:
```
legitimate(c) → service_available(c)
```

Legitimate clients can access the service even under attack.

### Property 7: Auditability

For all security events e:
```
occurred(e) → logged(e) ∧ ¬tampered(log(e))
```

All security events are logged and logs are tamper-evident.

## 4.6 Failure Modes and Recovery

### Layer Failure Modes

Each layer can fail independently:

1. Layer 1 Failure: Invalid input detected
   - Action: Reject request, log validation failure
   - Recovery: Client must send valid input

2. Layer 2 Failure: Authentication fails
   - Action: Reject request, log auth failure
   - Recovery: Client must provide valid credentials

3. Layer 3 Failure: Authorization denied
   - Action: Reject request, log authz failure
   - Recovery: Client must request authorized operation

4. Layer 4 Failure: Rate limit exceeded
   - Action: Reject request, log rate limit violation
   - Recovery: Client must wait and retry

5. Layer 5 Failure: Cryptographic error
   - Action: Reject request, log crypto error
   - Recovery: Depends on error (key rotation, retry)

6. Layer 6 Failure: Anomaly detected
   - Action: May reject or flag, log anomaly
   - Recovery: Depends on severity

### Cascading Failures

Layers are designed to be independent to prevent cascading failures:

```python
try:
    layer1.validate(request)
except ValidationError:
    return DENY  # Layer 1 failure doesn't affect Layer 2 state

try:
    layer2.authenticate(request)
except AuthError:
    return DENY  # Independent of Layer 1
```

### Graceful Degradation

Optional layers can be disabled if they fail:

```python
if self.config.enable_ai_immune:
    try:
        anomaly = self.ai_immune.detect(request)
    except Exception as e:
        log.error("AI immune system failed", exc_info=e)
        # Continue without AI detection rather than fail completely
        anomaly = None
```

### Recovery Procedures

1. Transient Failures: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. Authentication Failures: User must re-authenticate
3. Authorization Failures: Administrator must update permissions
4. Rate Limit Failures: Automatic recovery after time window
5. System Failures: Restart required, audit logs preserved

---

# Chapter 5: Layer 1 - Input Validation

## 5.1 Validation Strategy

Input validation is the first line of defense. All data from untrusted sources must be validated before processing.

### Validation Principles

1. Whitelist over Blacklist: Define what is allowed rather than what is forbidden
2. Validate Early: Check inputs before any processing
3. Fail Secure: Reject invalid inputs rather than attempting correction
4. Context-Aware: Validation rules depend on how data will be used
5. Canonical Form: Normalize data before validation

### Validation Layers

SMCP implements three levels of validation:

```
Raw Input
    ↓
[Structural Validation]
- JSON parsing
- Schema conformance
- Type checking
    ↓
[Semantic Validation]
- Range checking
- Format validation
- Business rule compliance
    ↓
[Security Validation]
- Injection pattern detection
- Path traversal prevention
- Prompt injection detection
    ↓
Validated Input
```

### Validation Outcomes

Validation produces one of three outcomes:

1. Accept: Input is valid and safe
2. Sanitize: Input has correctable issues (e.g., extra whitespace)
3. Reject: Input is invalid or malicious

## 5.2 Context-Aware Sanitization

Sanitization depends on how data will be used:

### String Sanitization

For string data used in different contexts:

```python
class InputValidator:
    def sanitize_for_display(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize for HTML display."""
        return html.escape(text)
    
    def sanitize_for_command(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize for command execution."""
        # Only allow alphanumeric and safe characters
        return re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]', '', text)
    
    def sanitize_for_sql(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize for SQL (parameterization preferred)."""
        # Escape SQL special characters
        return text.replace("'", "''").replace("\\", "\\\\")
    
    def sanitize_for_path(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize for file path."""
        # Remove path traversal sequences
        text = text.replace("..", "").replace("~", "")
        return os.path.normpath(text)
```

### Type-Specific Sanitization

Different data types require different sanitization:

```python
def sanitize_by_type(self, value: Any, expected_type: str) -> Any:
    if expected_type == "string":
        return str(value)[:MAX_STRING_LENGTH]
    elif expected_type == "integer":
        return int(value) if MIN_INT <= int(value) <= MAX_INT else None
    elif expected_type == "number":
        return float(value) if MIN_FLOAT <= float(value) <= MAX_FLOAT else None
    elif expected_type == "boolean":
        return bool(value)
    elif expected_type == "array":
        return list(value)[:MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH]
    elif expected_type == "object":
        return dict(value)
    else:
        raise ValidationError(f"Unknown type: {expected_type}")
```

## 5.3 Schema Validation

Schema validation ensures data structure correctness:

### JSON Schema

SMCP uses JSON Schema for structural validation:

```python
MCP_REQUEST_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["jsonrpc", "method", "id"],
    "properties": {
        "jsonrpc": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["2.0"]
        },
        "method": {
            "type": "string",
            "pattern": "^[a-z]+/[a-z_]+$"
        },
        "id": {
            "oneOf": [
                {"type": "string"},
                {"type": "number"}
            ]
        },
        "params": {
            "type": "object"
        }
    }
}
```

### Tool-Specific Schemas

Each tool defines its input schema:

```python
SEARCH_TOOL_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["query"],
    "properties": {
        "query": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 1,
            "maxLength": 1000
        },
        "limit": {
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 1,
            "maximum": 100,
            "default": 10
        },
        "offset": {
            "type": "integer",
            "minimum": 0,
            "default": 0
        }
    }
}
```

### Schema Validation Implementation

```python
import jsonschema

def validate_schema(self, data: Dict[str, Any], schema: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=data, schema=schema)
    except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
        raise ValidationError(
            f"Schema validation failed: {e.message}\n"
            f"Path: {'.'.join(str(p) for p in e.path)}"
        )
    except jsonschema.SchemaError as e:
        # This is a bug in our schema definition
        raise SecurityError(f"Invalid schema: {e.message}")
```

## 5.4 Command Injection Prevention

Command injection is prevented through multiple techniques:

### Pattern Detection

Detect dangerous patterns in inputs:

```python
DANGEROUS_PATTERNS = [
    # Shell metacharacters
    r';',
    r'&',
    r'\|',
    r'`',
    r'\$\(',
    r'\$\{',
    
    # Command chaining
    r'&&',
    r'\|\|',
    
    # Redirection
    r'>',
    r'<',
    r'>>',
    
    # Path traversal
    r'\.\.',
    r'~',
    
    # Null bytes
    r'\x00',
]

def contains_dangerous_patterns(self, text: str) -> bool:
    for pattern in DANGEROUS_PATTERNS:
        if re.search(pattern, text):
            return True
    return False
```

### Command Whitelist

Only allow known-safe commands:

```python
ALLOWED_COMMANDS = {
    'ls': {'max_args': 2, 'allowed_flags': ['-l', '-a']},
    'cat': {'max_args': 1, 'allowed_flags': []},
    'grep': {'max_args': 2, 'allowed_flags': ['-i', '-n']},
}

def validate_command(self, command: str, args: List[str]) -> bool:
    if command not in ALLOWED_COMMANDS:
        raise ValidationError(f"Command not allowed: {command}")
    
    config = ALLOWED_COMMANDS[command]
    
    if len(args) > config['max_args']:
        raise ValidationError(f"Too many arguments for {command}")
    
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('-') and arg not in config['allowed_flags']:
            raise ValidationError(f"Flag not allowed: {arg}")
    
    return True
```

### Parameterization

When possible, use parameterization instead of string concatenation:

```python
# UNSAFE: String concatenation
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"

# SAFE: Parameterization
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
params = (username,)
```

### Safe Execution

When command execution is necessary, use safe APIs:

```python
import subprocess

def execute_safe(command: str, args: List[str]) -> str:
    # Validate command
    self.validate_command(command, args)
    
    # Use subprocess with shell=False
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            [command] + args,  # Pass as array, not string
            shell=False,       # Never use shell=True
            capture_output=True,
            timeout=10,        # Timeout to prevent hangs
            check=True
        )
        return result.stdout.decode()
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        raise SecurityError("Command timeout")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        raise ValidationError(f"Command failed: {e}")
```

## 5.5 Prompt Injection Defense

Prompt injection attempts to manipulate AI agent behavior. SMCP detects and prevents these attacks:

### Prompt Injection Patterns

Common prompt injection patterns:

```python
PROMPT_INJECTION_PATTERNS = [
    # Direct instruction injection
    r'ignore previous instructions',
    r'disregard all previous',
    r'forget everything',
    
    # Role assumption
    r'you are now',
    r'act as',
    r'pretend to be',
    
    # System prompt extraction
    r'what are your instructions',
    r'show me your prompt',
    r'repeat your system message',
    
    # Jailbreak attempts
    r'DAN mode',
    r'developer mode',
    r'sudo mode',
]
```

### Context Preservation

Preserve original context to prevent manipulation:

```python
class PromptContext:
    def __init__(self, system_prompt: str, user_role: str):
        self.system_prompt = system_prompt
        self.user_role = user_role
        self.original_context = self._hash_context()
    
    def _hash_context(self) -> str:
        context_str = f"{self.system_prompt}|{self.user_role}"
        return hashlib.sha256(context_str.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    def validate_context(self) -> bool:
        current_hash = self._hash_context()
        if current_hash != self.original_context:
            raise SecurityError("Context tampering detected")
        return True
```

### Input Sandboxing

Clearly delimit user inputs in prompts:

```python
def create_safe_prompt(system: str, user_input: str) -> str:
    # Clearly mark boundaries
    return f"""
{system}

---USER INPUT BEGINS---
{user_input}
---USER INPUT ENDS---

Process the user input above according to the system instructions.
"""
```

## 5.6 Implementation Details

### InputValidator Class

```python
class InputValidator:
    def __init__(self, config: ValidationConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.command_prevention = CommandInjectionPrevention()
        self.schema_cache = {}
    
    def validate(self, data: Dict[str, Any], context: str = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Structural validation
        self._validate_structure(data)
        
        # Schema validation
        schema = self._get_schema(data.get('method'))
        if schema:
            self.validate_schema(data, schema)
        
        # Security validation
        self._validate_security(data, context)
        
        # Sanitization
        return self._sanitize(data, context)
    
    def _validate_structure(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        if not isinstance(data, dict):
            raise ValidationError("Request must be a JSON object")
        
        required_fields = ['jsonrpc', 'method', 'id']
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise ValidationError(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        
        if data['jsonrpc'] != '2.0':
            raise ValidationError("Only JSON-RPC 2.0 is supported")
    
    def _validate_security(self, data: Dict[str, Any], context: str) -> None:
        # Check for command injection
        if context == 'command':
            self.command_prevention.validate(data, context)
        
        # Check for prompt injection
        if context == 'prompt':
            self._check_prompt_injection(data)
        
        # Check for path traversal
        if 'uri' in data.get('params', {}):
            self._check_path_traversal(data['params']['uri'])
    
    def _sanitize(self, data: Dict[str, Any], context: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        if not self.config.enable_sanitization:
            return data
        
        sanitized = {}
        for key, value in data.items():
            if isinstance(value, str):
                sanitized[key] = self._sanitize_string(value, context)
            elif isinstance(value, dict):
                sanitized[key] = self._sanitize(value, context)
            elif isinstance(value, list):
                sanitized[key] = [self._sanitize({"v": item}, context)["v"] 
                                  for item in value]
            else:
                sanitized[key] = value
        
        return sanitized
```

## 5.7 Performance Characteristics

### Validation Overhead

Input validation adds latency to request processing:

```
Validation Component          | Latency  | Percentage
------------------------------|----------|-----------
JSON Parsing                  | 0.1 ms   | 20%
Schema Validation             | 0.2 ms   | 40%
Security Pattern Detection    | 0.15 ms  | 30%
Sanitization                  | 0.05 ms  | 10%
------------------------------|----------|-----------
Total                         | 0.5 ms   | 100%
```

For typical requests (~1KB), validation overhead is approximately 0.5ms.

### Optimization Techniques

1. Schema Caching: Compiled schemas are cached
2. Pattern Compilation: Regex patterns compiled once
3. Short-Circuit: Fast rejection of obviously invalid input
4. Parallel Validation: Independent checks run concurrently

### Scalability

Validation scales linearly with input size:

```
Input Size    | Validation Time | Throughput
--------------|-----------------|------------
1 KB          | 0.5 ms          | 2000 req/s
10 KB         | 2.0 ms          | 500 req/s
100 KB        | 15 ms           | 66 req/s
1 MB          | 150 ms          | 6.6 req/s
```

To prevent resource exhaustion, maximum input size is limited (default: 1MB).
