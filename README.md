# Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP) v1

## Academic Paper and Security Framework Implementation

### Abstract

This repository contains the academic paper "Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP) v1: A Security Framework for AI Agent Interactions" along with the complete implementation of the security framework.

The paper presents a security architecture designed to address critical vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), including command injection, privilege escalation, authentication bypass, and supply chain attacks. Our framework implements multiple layers of defense including input validation, cryptographic security, AI-based anomaly detection, and access control mechanisms.

### Paper Overview

**Title**: Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP) v1: A Security Framework for AI Agent Interactions

**Authors**: Research Team, Secure AI Systems Laboratory

**Abstract**: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a critical standard for AI agent interactions with external tools and services. However, current implementations suffer from significant security vulnerabilities including command injection, privilege escalation, and authentication bypass. This paper presents SMCP v1, a security framework that addresses these vulnerabilities through multi-layered defense mechanisms. Our framework implements input validation with command injection prevention, authentication and authorization using token-based RBAC, rate limiting for DoS protection, cryptographic security using ChaCha20-Poly1305 and Argon2, and an AI-based immune system for anomaly detection. Performance evaluation demonstrates minimal overhead (<5%) while providing protection against 15+ attack vectors. The framework successfully mitigated 100% of tested command injection attempts, 98% of privilege escalation attacks, and 99.7% of authentication bypass attempts in our security evaluation.

### Key Features

#### Security Components
- Input Validation Layer: Advanced parsing and sanitization with command injection prevention
- Authentication System: Multi-factor authentication with JWT tokens and session management
- Authorization Framework: Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- Rate Limiting: Adaptive rate limiting with DoS protection and traffic shaping
- Cryptographic Security: ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encryption with Argon2 key derivation
- AI Immune System: Machine learning-based anomaly detection and threat classification
- Audit System: Logging and monitoring with real-time alerting

#### Performance Metrics
- Latency Overhead: <5ms additional latency per request
- Throughput Impact: <3% reduction in maximum throughput
- Memory Usage: <50MB additional memory footprint
- CPU Overhead: <5% additional CPU utilization
- Attack Detection: 99.2% accuracy in threat classification
