### Security Test Categories

1. **Attack Prevention Tests**
   ```python
   def test_command_injection_blocked():
       malicious_input = {"command": "ls; rm -rf /"}
       with pytest.raises(SecurityError):
           validator.validate_input(malicious_input)
   ```

2. **Authentication Tests**
   ```python
   def test_jwt_token_validation():
       invalid_token = "invalid.jwt.token"
       with pytest.raises(AuthenticationError):
           authenticator.validate_token(invalid_token)
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting Tests**
   ```python
   def test_rate_limit_enforcement():
       for _ in range(101):  # Exceed limit
           rate_limiter.check_rate_limit("user123")
       with pytest.raises(RateLimitError):
           rate_limiter.check_rate_limit("user123")
   ```
